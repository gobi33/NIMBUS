      <h1>About IAM Project</h1>
      <p>This project is focused on Identity and Access Management (IAM), incorporating both an IAM Chatbot and an IAM Dashboard.</p>
      <p>The <strong>IAM Chatbot</strong> generates ideas about what permissions can be given for different roles.</p>
      <p>The <strong>IAM Dashboard</strong> assigns roles and responsibilities over the web application.</p>
      <p>The project utilizes <strong>Firebase</strong> as the backend, with frontend and backend development in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python</strong>.</p>
     <p>DROKER :         Understanding Role-Based Permissions

      <p>DROKER is designed to help users and administrators quickly understand the</p>    
      <p>permissions associated with different roles in the IAM system. Here’s a</p> 
      <p>detailed explanation of how DROKER provides insights into role-based</p> 
      <p>permissions:</p>

        <p>How DROKER Works:</p>

          <p>Role Inquiry :</p>

            <p>Function: </p>

              <p>When a user or administrator enters a specific role into DROKER, the  chatbot processes the request to provide information about that role’s associated permissions.</p>

                <p>Example: A user might input "Manager" to find out what permissions are granted to a person with this role.</p>
